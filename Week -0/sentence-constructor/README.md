# Japanese Sentence Constructor

A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Japanese. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

## Instructions

This is a level-100 task so we have to use already available AI-powered assistants like ChatGPT and Claude. I used Gemini 1.5pro becuase a pro model is better than a normal one and it was available for free on Google AI Studio.
